\begin{abstract}
The article discusses one of the optimization problems
that arise when modeling the tool path for CNC sheet metal
cutting machines for the case when the boundary contours
of the parts are defined by polygons and the pierce points
are located on the boundary contours.
Only closed-loop cutting is used,
i.e. Continuous Cutting Problem (CCP),
hence
the task of minimizing the length of the tool path
is reduced to the problem of finding the minimum air move length,
which is shown to be equivalent to the problem of finding
the shortest polyline with vertices on disjoint contours in the plane,
while these contours do not contain internal contours.
An algorithm for constructing minimal length broken line
for a fixed order of cutting contours is described
and is proved to provide local minimum.
Sufficient conditions for this minimum to be global are given.
Heuristic algorithm is suggested for finding the optimal order for cutting contours.
The results of a computational experiment
and a comparison of the results with an exact solution for the GTSP problem are presented.

\section{Introduction}

A number of optimization problems arise
during development of control programs for CNC sheet cutting machines.
One of them is
the task of minimizing the tool air move,
which in some special cases can be reduced
to the problem of finding the shortest polyline
with vertices on flat contours.
Contours are interpreted as the boundaries of flat parts.
The location of the contours on the plane is determined
during the solution of the ``nesting'' problem.
Both tasks are generally NP-hard.

In its turn,
the task of minimizing tool air move
is a subtask of another optimization problem --
the task of optimizing the tool path when cutting flat parts.
Its exact solution cannot be obtained for problems
that actually arise in production
(for hundreds of parts / contours) in a reasonable time,
therefore,
various heuristics are typically applied
to get solutions of acceptable quality.
At the same time, the issues of developing algorithms
that provide optimal solutions for some problem cases,
as well as evaluating the quality of their solutions
in comparison with the optimal solution,
remain unresolved and are of significant scientific interest.

The general problem of optimizing the tool path
when cutting 2D objects on CNC machines,
which consists in minimizing cutting time and cost,
includes a whole range of different optimization tasks.
A classification of such problems
can be found
in \cite{bi01,bi02,bi03}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Continuous Cutting Problem (CCP): each closed contour (that bounds a part)
  is cut out entirely by one movement of the torch,
  but cutting can start from any point (and finishes at the same point).

  \item
  Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP):
  cutting can start only at one of the predefined points on the contour,
  the contour must be cut entirely.

  \item
  Endpoint Cutting Problem (ECP):
  cutting can start only at one of the predefined points on the contour,
  and the contour can be cut in several approaches, in parts.

  \item
  Segment Continuous Cutting Problem (SCCP):
  the notion of a cutting segment is introduced,
  which is a generalization of a contour;
  it can be either a part of a contour
  or a combination of several contours or their parts.
  Each segment is cut out entirely, thus
  $ CCP \subset SCCP$.

  \item
  Generalized Segment Continuous Cutting Problem (GSCCP):
  segment cutting (SCCP),
  but the selection of segments is not fixed in advance,
  but is subject to optimization

  \item
  Intermittent Cutting Problem (ICP):
  the most general cutting problem described in the literature,
  when contours can be cut in parts,
  in several approaches,
  and cutting can begin at any point in the contour.
\end{itemize}

Tool path optimization problems
in practice often reduce to discrete optimization problems
by discretizing the contours to be cut with a certain step
$\varepsilon$,
that is, they reduce to ECP
\cite{bi04,bi05,bi06}
or its special case, GTSP
\cite{bi07,bi08,bi09,bi10}.
CCP can also be reduced to GTSP.
In this case, however,
the total error in the air move length reaches
$N \cdot \varepsilon$,
where $N$ is the number of contours.
To guarantee the accuracy of the result of
$\delta$,
it is necessary to choose a small
$\varepsilon \approx \delta / N$,
so the total number of points on the contour grows
(as $O (N)$)
and the exhaustive search becomes exponential.
Nevertheless, such problems can be successfully solved,
for example, by the dynamic programming method,
for small
$N \approx 30$ even precisely (see, in particular ???).

Tool path routing without using discretization (CCP)
is further considered in this paper.
The publications on this subject
are rare.
\cite{bi11,bi12}
can be noted,
where
heuristic algorithms are proposed.
