\begin{abstract}
The optimization problem of the shortest path
between a set of non-intersecting contours on a plane is considered.
These types of problems arise, in particular,
at the tool path design for the CNC sheet cutting machines.
It is shown that this problem is equivalent to a subproblem
with a set of contours that do not contain internal contours.
A heuristic algorithm for solving the problem based on the combinatorial approach is proposed.
The results of the computational experiment are described.
A lower bound for the optimal value of the objective function is proposed.
