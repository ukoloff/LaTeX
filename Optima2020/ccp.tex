An optimization problem that arises during
tool path routing for
CNC sheet cutting machine
is considered
for the case when
parts are bounded by
line segments and circular arcs
and pierce points lay
on the bounds.
Technique of
continuous cutting is used,
i.e.
each contour is cut as a whole
from any starting point.
The task of
tool path length minimization
is reduced to the task
of air move length minimization
which is shown to be equivalent
to finding the shortest broken line
with vertices on
non-nesting disjoint contours on the plane.
The algorithm of building such
a broken line
for a fixed order of contour processing
is devised
and proved to deliver local minimum.
Some sufficient conditions
for this minimum to be global
are discussed.
A heuristic algorithm
for finding the optimal contour cutting order
is proposed
based on
Variable Neighborhood Search approach.
Results of a computational experiment

\section{Introduction}

A number of optimization problems arise
during development of control programs for CNC sheet cutting machines.
One of them is
the task of minimizing the tool air move,
which in some special cases can be reduced
to the problem of finding the shortest polyline
with vertices on flat contours.
Contours are interpreted as the boundaries of flat parts.
The location of the contours on the plane is determined
during the solution of the ``nesting'' problem.
Both tasks are generally NP-hard.

In its turn,
the task of minimizing tool air move
is a subtask of another optimization problem --
the task of optimizing the tool path when cutting flat parts.
Its exact solution cannot be obtained for problems
that actually arise in production
(for hundreds of parts / contours) in a reasonable time,
therefore,
various heuristics are typically applied
to get solutions of acceptable quality.
At the same time, the issues of developing algorithms
that provide optimal solutions for some problem cases,
as well as evaluating the quality of their solutions
in comparison with the optimal solution,
remain unresolved and are of significant scientific interest.

The general problem of optimizing the tool path
when cutting 2D objects on CNC machines,
which consists in minimizing cutting time and cost,
includes a whole range of different optimization tasks.
A classification of such problems
can be found
in \cite{bi01,bi02,bi03},
see Fig. \ref{CP-classes}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Continuous Cutting Problem (CCP): each closed contour (that bounds a part)
  is cut out entirely by one movement of the torch,
  but cutting can start from any point (and finishes at the same point).

  \item
  Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP):
  cutting can start only at one of the predefined points on the contour,
  the contour must be cut entirely.

  \item
  Endpoint Cutting Problem (ECP):
  cutting can start only at one of the predefined points on the contour,
  and the contour can be cut in several approaches, in parts.

  \item
  Segment Continuous Cutting Problem (SCCP):
  the notion of a cutting segment is introduced,
  which is a generalization of a contour;
  it can be either a part of a contour
  or a combination of several contours or their parts.
  Each segment is cut out entirely, thus
  $ CCP \subset SCCP$.

  \item
  Generalized Segment Continuous Cutting Problem (GSCCP):
  segment cutting (SCCP),
  but the selection of segments is not fixed in advance,
  but is subject to optimization

  \item
  Intermittent Cutting Problem (ICP):
  the most general cutting problem described in the literature,
  when contours can be cut in parts,
  in several approaches,
  and cutting can begin at any point in the contour.
\end{itemize}

Tool path optimization problems
in practice often reduce to discrete optimization problems
by discretizing the contours to be cut with a certain step
$\varepsilon$,
that is, they reduce to ECP
\cite{bi04,bi05,bi06}
or its special case, GTSP
\cite{bi07,bi08,bi09,bi10}.
CCP can also be reduced to GTSP.
In this case, however,
the total error in the air move length reaches
$N \cdot \varepsilon$,
where $N$ is the number of contours.
To guarantee the accuracy of the result of
$\delta$,
it is necessary to choose a small
$\varepsilon \approx \delta / N$,
so the total number of points on the contour grows
(as $O (N)$)
and the exhaustive search becomes exponential.
Nevertheless, such problems can be successfully solved,
for example, by the dynamic programming
(DP)
method,
for small
$N \approx 30$ even precisely
(see, in particular \cite{bi15}).

Tool path routing without using discretization (CCP)
is further considered in this paper.
The publications on this subject
are rare.
\cite{bi11,bi12}
can be noted,
where
heuristic algorithms are proposed.

\subsection{Technological constraints}

The need to execute the tool path on a
CNC sheet cutting machine imposes
a number of technological limitations on it.

The so-called ``precedence constraint''
is by far most popular in the literature.
It is caused by the fact that after cutting a closed contour,
its interior is usually not held by anything
and can freely shift, rotate and even fall.
For this reason,
the internal contours of parts must be cut
before the external contours containing them,
and parts located in the holes of large parts even earlier.

Finally, most cutting technologies require
that the cutting not be carried out strictly along the contour,
but with some indentation.
This shift can be performed both during the solution of the routing problem,
and after -- at the stage of generating the control program for the CNC cutting machine
or even by the machine itself during the cutting process.
In addition, the pierce point (tool switch-on point)
should generally be located even further
from the contour to avoid part damage.
However, this work completely ignores this requirement.
Thus, it is further assumed that the tool moves exactly
along the contour of the part
and the pierce point is located directly on the contour
(as well as the switch-off point of the tool).

\section{Continuous Cutting Problem}

Consider the Euclidean plane
$\mathbb R ^ 2$
and its region $B$ bounded by a closed contour
(rectangle in most cases),
which is a model of the sheet material to be cut.
Let $N$ pairwise disjoint flat contours
$\{C_1, C_2, ... C_N\}$
be given inside $B$, bounding $n$ parts
$\{A_1, A_2 ... A_n\}$.
A part can be limited by either one contour or several
(external and internal holes),
so that in general
$n \le N$.

The contours
$C_i$
can have an arbitrary shape,
but we will only consider the case
when they consist of (a finite number of)
segments of lines and arcs of circles,
which is determined by the existing technological equipment.
In case when the contours consist only of line segments,
the continuous cutting problem
is reduced to one of the variants of the
Touring Polygon Problem (TPP),
see \cite{bi13}.

Further, two points are set in region $B$ (usually at its boundary),
we denote them as
$M_0$, $M_{N + 1}$
(almost always $M_0 = M_{N + 1}$),
which represent the beginning and end of the cutting route.

Continuous Cutting Problem is to find:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $N$ pierce points $M_i \in C_i, i \in \overline{1, N}$
\item Contour $C_i$ traversal order, i.e. permutations of $N$ elements $I = (i_1, i_2, ... i_N)$
\end{enumerate}

The result of solving the problem will be the route
$\{M_0, M_{i_1}, M_{i_2}, \ \dots M_{i_N}, \allowbreak M_{N + 1}\}$.
The objective function in this case is greatly simplified
in comparison with the general cutting problem
and is reduced to minimizing the air move length.

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = \sum_{j=0}^N|M_{i_j}M_{i_{j+1}}|
  \label{air-move-length}
\end{equation}
$$
\mathcal{L} \to \min
$$

Where, for sake of simplicity, we introduce the notation
$M_{i_0} = M_0$,
$M_{i_{N + 1}} = M_{N + 1}$.

In addition,
we will solve the optimization problem
with an additional constraint,
the so-called ``precedence constraint''.
Although the contours $C_i$
do not intersect,
they can be nested into each other, i.e.,
$\tilde{C_a} Ìƒ\subset \tilde{C_b}$,
where
$\tilde{C_a}$
denotes a 2-dimensional figure bounded by the contour
$C_a$
(in the more familiar notation
$C_a = \partial \tilde{C_a}$).
In the general tool path routing problem,
this can be caused by two different circumstances
(holes in parts and
placement of smaller parts
in holes larger to save material),
but in this case
these options are processed the same way.

If one contour is located inside another,
then the nested contour must be cut out
(visited)
earlier than the outer one:
$\tilde{C_a} Ìƒ\subset \tilde{C_b} Ìƒ\Rightarrow i_a < i_b$
in the permutation
$I = (i_1, i_2, ... i_N)$.
Thus, not all permutation of the contours are feasible.

\section{CCP-Relax Algorithm to solve Continuous Cutting Problem}
\label{sec:ccp-relax}

The proposed solution algorithm
consists of several stages,
easily associated with the nature of the problem being solved:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item {\bf Removal of external contours}.
  To automatically comply with the precedence constraint,
  we start by removing all contours containing nested ones.

  This generally leads to a reduction
  (significant in some cases)
  of the size of the problem
  (from $N$ to some $N'$),
  and thus reduces the calculation time
  in the second and especially the third stage.

  \item {\bf Continuous optimization}.
  Assuming the order of contours processing
  $I = (i_1, i_2, ... i_N)$
  fixed we look for the coordinates of the pierce points
  $M_i \in C_i$,
  minimizing the total air move length (\ref{air-move-length}).

  For every pierce point $M_i$
  we find it's optimal position,
  while others remain motionless.
  This relaxation is repeated a few times
  until converged.
  In practice,
  it happens very fast in
  $O(N)$
  time and is therefore used
  as a subroutine in the next step.

  \item{\bf Discrete optimization}.
  We use
  Variable Neighborhood Search
  (VNS, see \cite{bi14})
  to find contours processing order
  $I = (i_1, i_2, ... i_N)$.

  This step in fact solves famous
  {\it Travelling Salesman Problem}
  with special distance function,
  calculated at the previous step:
  $$
  \mathcal L (I') = \min_{M_1, M_2 \dots M_N}
    \mathcal L (M_1, M_2 \dots M_N | I')
  $$

  Note, that other heuristics
  for discrete optimization
  may be used at this step as well.
  For instance,
  one can use modern solvers
  to first solve GTSP problem,
  associated with CCP,
  and then apply continuous relaxation
  (previous step)
  to convert solution of GTSP to
  that of CCP.
  This idea deserves further investigation.

  \item{\bf Recovery of removed contours}.
  Having got the tool path that visits ``inner''
  contours
  (remained after first step),
  we find piercing points for other contours
  by simple intersecting them with the tool path.
  Of multiple points we select one
  (for each contour)
  so as to meet precedence constraint.

  This is straightforward step of linear
  time complexity.

\end{enumerate}

For detailed explanation of the CCP-Relax algorithm steps
refer to
\cite{berlin2019}.

\subsection{Optimality of continuous optimization problem solution}
\label{sec:math}

From a practical point of view,
the described algorithm turns out to be quite workable --
it generates high-quality tool path routes in an acceptable time,
but this is an empirical result.
The theoretical justification of the properties
of the resulting routes is interesting.
The greatest difficulty is, of course,
the third step of the algorithm --
discrete optimization,
both from a theoretical and a
practical point of view.
This work focuses the second step of the algorithm --
continuous optimization.

\begin{remark}
Fig. \ref{counter-example} shows an example where a trajectory
that is not improved by shifts of vertices individually
may not deliver a global minimum.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Two tool paths delivering local minimum}
  \label{counter-example}
  \end{figure}
\end{remark}

We were able to formulate some statements
regarding the quality of continuous optimization
solutions at Step 2 of CCP-Relax algorithm.
We present them here without proof,
which will be published in a separate paper.

We consider the case of fixed order
of contours processing
$I = (i_1, i_2, ... i_N)$.
and apply Step 2 of CCP-Relax algorithm
to get broken line
$L_*$,
visiting all the contours $C_i$
in the said order.

\begin{proposition}
If we move several adjacent vertices of the broken line
$L_*$
so that they remain on the same segments of the contours,
then the length of the resulting broken line will not decrease.
\end{proposition}

This statement means that the algorithm always delivers a local minimum,
however not yet global,
as for example in
Fig.~\ref{counter-example}.

To guarantee the latter,
the following sufficient condition may be required:

\begin{condition}
  \thlabel{cond2}
Let \textbf{one} of the following requirements be satisfied
for every piercing point $M_i$:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Segment $M_{i-1} M_{i+1}$ intersects the contour
  $C_i$,
  i.e.
  $M_i \in M_{i-1} M_{i+1}$
  \item
  The tangent at
  $M_i$
  to the ellipse with foci
  $M_{i-1}$
  and
  $M_{i+1}$
  and passing through
  $M_i$
  separates the ellipse and the contour
  $C_i$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{condition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \thref{cond2}
  is satisfied for
  (every vertex of)
  $L_*$.

  If we move several adjacent vertices of the broken line
  $L_*$ so that they remain on the contours,
  then the length of the resulting broken line does not decrease,
  that is, the broken line
  $L_*$ delivers a global minimum.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
Suppose that besides the trajectory
$L_*$ ,
there is another trajectory delivering a global minimum.
Then it follows from the last statement
that they coincide as lines,
that is,
the difference can only be at
the points of intersection with the contours.
\end{remark}

\thref{cond2}
is easily verified programmatically,
but it can be simplified
so that in most practical cases
to be checked simply visually.

\begin{condition}
When segment
$M_{i-1} M_{i+1}$
doesn't intersects the contour
$C_i$ but
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  If the vertex
  $M_i$
  is the internal point of the linear segment of the contour
  and the entire contour
  $C_i$
  is on one side of the that segment line
  (which is the tangent from \thref{cond2};
  otherwise there must be a better
  $M'_i\in C_i$).
  \item
  If the vertex
  $M_i$ is terminal
  (belongs to two linear segments of the contour;
  is also vertex of $C_i$),
  and the entire contour is inside
  the corner with the rays from the point
  $M_i$ along these segments.
  \item
  If the region
  $\tilde{C_i}$
  bounded by the contour
  $C_i$ is convex
\end{enumerate}
\end{condition}

\section{New Approach to Intermittent Cutting Problem}

Intermittent Cutting Problem
is the most complex and general
of all varieties of cutting problems.
It can be approached to
both from theoretical positions
as well as by using some practical techniques.

In addition to standard cutting technique
(which in fact leads to
Continuous Cutting Problem),
some others are often used,
for instance,
``multi-segment'' and
``multi-contour'' cutting.
The former cuts single contour of a part
in several passes,
using several piercing points.
The latter cuts a few contours
at once,
as seen at
Fig.~\ref{fig:6x5}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pentagons.png}
  \caption{Example of complex cutting segment for six parts / contours}
  \label{fig:6x5}
\end{figure}

In order to apply those technique
we introduce a notion
(see \cite{bib:petunin-2019}):

{\it Cutting Segment}
$S = \overrightarrow{M M^*}$
is a tool trajectory from piercing point $M$
up to point of switching tool off $M^*$.

Cutting segment is used to contain single contour,
but this is not the case any more.
It also can be a part of contour
(for multi-segment cutting)
as well as several contours at once
(i.e. multi-contour cutting).

In fact,
multi-contour cutting example
at Fig.~\ref{fig:6x5}
can also represent a single
cutting segment
in some bigger cutting problem instance.

Since the cutting direction is defined for the cutting segment,
we need a more general concept:

{\it Basic Segment}
$B^S$
is a part of cutting segment
$S = \overrightarrow{M M^*}$
without lead-in  and lead-out trajectory
(the very beginning and ending parts of segment,
where tool approaches contour of a part
and leaves it).
Basic segment has no direction and
contains only geometry of contours to cut.

Using the concept of basic segment,
we can now formulate a generalization of CCP:

{\it Segment Continuous Cutting Problem}
($SCCP$)
is a cutting problem with fixed set
(as well as number of)
basic cutting segments:
$SCCP = \left\{B^{S_i}\right\}$.

CCP-Relax algorithm described above
can be applied to solve SCCP problem
in the same way as for CCP problem
for which it was originally designed.

And now,
note that
for predefined nesting
(i.e. fixed positioning of
parts' contours on the plain),
the whole {\it ensemble} of basic segments
can be generated
by combining and dividing
contours into different segments.
See, for instance,
Fig.~\ref{fig:gsccp},
where multi-contour segments
are filled with black color.
This leads us to even more general:

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[Standard cutting, 45 segments]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{nest45.png}
  }
  \subfloat[Multi-contour cutting, 39 segments]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.47\columnwidth]{nest39.png}
  }
  \caption{{\it Ensemble} of Segment Cutting Problems}
  \label{fig:gsccp}
\end{figure}


{\it Generalized Segment Continuous Cutting Problem}
($GSCCP$)
is that {\it ensemble} of several $SCCP$
problems for the same nesting:
$GSCCP = \left\{ SCCP_i \right\}$.

By introducing the class of $GSCCP$,
we have significantly expanded the existing
classification of tool path problem for CNC sheet cutting machines.
Actually $SCCP$ and $GSCCP$ are $ICP$
subclasses containing all tasks with finite sets of basic cutting segments,
i.e.
$ CCP \subset SCCP \subset GSCCP \subset ICP$.

\subsection*{General scheme for GSCCP solving}

Assuming an ensemble
$\left\{ SCCP_i \right\}$
of base segment sets
$SCCP_i = \left\{B^{S_j}\right\}$,
$
i \in \overline{1, T},
j \in \overline{1, K_i}
$
to be known,
the following scheme for GSCCP solving
is presented:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Each task $SCCP_i$ is solved independently
  with one of existing algorithms, for instance:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    {\it CCP-Relax}, heuristic described above in section~\ref{sec:ccp-relax}.
    \item
    {\it DP-GTSP}, exact algorithm based on Dymaic programming
    for the case of relatively small problem dimensions,
    see \cite{bi15}
    \item
    {\it Greedy-GTSP}, iterative greedy heuristic algorithm,
    see \cite{bib:greedy}
  \end{enumerate}
  For discrete algorithm to use,
  cutting segments can be pre-sampled as shown
  at Fig.~\ref{fig:gtsp425}.

  \item
  The best solution is selected
  according to objective function (\ref{air-move-length}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{gtsp425.png}
  \caption{
    Corresponding GTSP problem for (S)CCP problem of Fig.~\ref{fig:gsccp},\\
    425 points
  }
  \label{fig:gtsp425}
\end{figure}

For example,
Fig.~\ref{fig:gsccp-cut}
shows two solutions
of $SCCP$ problems from Fig.~\ref{fig:gsccp}
given by {\it CCP-Relax} algorithm.
It is easy to see that the two routes are indeed different.
Furthermore,
the difference can be even more significant in a practical sense
due to different numbers of piercing points,
since that operation
is rather expensive
both in terms of time and cost.

  }
  \caption{Solution of GSCCP Problem at Fig.~\ref{fig:gsccp}}

\end{figure}


\section{Numerical experiments}
\label{sec:calc}

The quality assessment of the solutions
of the described algorithm was carried out on several
cutting plans containing real parts.
As a comparison base, we used DP algorithm
(see \cite{bi15})
for solving the GTSP problem,
which gives an exact solution for small number of contours
and special version of GNLS heuristic \cite{GLNS}.

Fig. \ref{gtsp-path} shows the exact solution,
possible positions of the pierce points are visible.
Fig. \ref{ccp-path} shows the solution to the CCP problem
for the same cutting plan.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{464-gtsp.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Exact solution of GTSP, Job \#464}

\end{figure}

  \end{center}
  \caption{Solution of CCP, Job \#464}
  \label{ccp-path}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that both algorithms
generated almost identical routes.
The main difference is caused by the discretization process
to obtain the GTSP task.
Because of this,
the segments of the route that are straight in the CCP solution
turn out to be slightly broken in the GTSP solution,
hence total air move length is slightly larger.
Numerically, this is shown in table \ref{ccp-vs-gtsp}
for several cutting plans.

% See also: \cite{GLNS,KhachaiI,KhachayII,ChentsovIII}...
Fig. \ref{large-path}
shows the solution to the CCP problem for large dimension
(198 contours).
Unlike the previous example,
for large-dimensional problems
it is much more difficult to evaluate
the accuracy of the obtained solution.
Nevertheless,
a comparison with the results of solving
the corresponding task GTSP
can also serve as a way of estimation.
GTSP is known to be NP-hard even on the Euclidean plane \cite{bib:x103}.
Although it is clear that
the bigger the predefined partial order,
the simpler the appropriate GTSP task,
dependence of theoretical complexity bounds
on the properties of the precedence constraints
has not yet been insufficiently investigated.
In this regard, we note two papers \cite{bib:x104,bib:x105}.
There are two special types of the precedence constraints,
for which polynomial time complexity of the GTSP is proven theoretically.
The first type of constraints was introduced by E. Balas \cite{bib:x100}
for the classic TSP.
Efficient exact algorithms for the GTSP with precedence constraints
of this type are proposed in recent papers
\cite{bib:x102,ChentsovIII}.
Tours that fulfill constraints of the second type
are referred to as quasi- and pseudo-pyramidal.
Efficient parameterized algorithms for the GTSP
with such precedence constraints are proposed in \cite{KhachaiI,KhachayII}.
In view of the above,
we can summarize that in the field of algorithmic analysis,
the GTSP still remains weakly explored.
In particular,
the absence of efficient Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP)
models for the GTSP makes it impossible to use modern optimizers like Gurobi \cite{bib:x101}
for construction lower and upper bounds and examining the heuristic solutions.
This issue is also pending.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  The problem of minimizing tool air move of CNC sheet cutting machines
  for the routing problem from the CCP class
  is shown to be reduced
  to a problem without precedence constraint,
  which reduces the number of contours and the operating time of the algorithm
  \item
  A heuristic algorithm for solving the CCP problem is proposed that does not use contour discretization.
  \item
  It was proved that the CCP-Relax
  algorithm for finding piercing points for a fixed order of traversing the contours
  delivers a local minimum.
  \item
  Several easily verified sufficient conditions are formulated and proved
  for the specified algorithm to deliver global minimum of air move length.
  \item
  CCP-Relax
  algorithm can be applied to solving more general problems
  SCCP (Segment Cutting) and
  GSCCP (Generalized Segment Cutting),
  thus approaches to solving general
  ICP cutting problem can be developed on its basis.
\end{enumerate}

The direction of further research is the development of the algorithm
for the general case where the pierce points
are located
outside the contours
according to the technological requirements of sheet cutting.
