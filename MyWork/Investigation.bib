	abstract = {This paper deals with generating cutting paths for laser cutting machines by representing a tool path in a novel way. Using the new representation, the tool path problem can be viewed as finding a partitioning of contours which minimises the sum of the costs of a rooted directed minimum spanning tree to connect the partitions and the costs of a generalised travelling salesman problem (GTSP) solutions within each partition. Using Edmond-Lius algorithm to solve the arborescence problem, an improved Lin-Kernighan heuristic to solve the GTSP and a heuristic-repartitioning approach, tool paths can be generated that are 4.2\% faster than those generated by an existing tool path construction heuristic. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a new problem that arises when parts are cut from large plates of metal or glass. We call this problem the plate-cutting traveling salesman problem (P-TSP) because it requires the determination of a minimum-length tour such that exactly one point must be visited on each of a number of given polygons. We present a mathematical formulation of the problem and show that the problem is a variation of the well-known traveling salesman problem. We examine the problem when the order in which parts are to be cut is known. For this problem we present a Lagrangean decomposition of the problem and develop lower bounds and heuristics based on this decomposition. Computational testing on problems with 5-40 polygons reveals that the heuristics give fairly good solutions. When the order in which polygons are to be cut is known, the heuristic solutions are within 3-4\% of the optimal. The decomposition-based heuristics are embedded in a variable r-opt heuristic for the overall problem. © 1997 "IIE".},

	abstract = {In the paper the problem of tool path optimization for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) cutting machines is considered. The classification of the cutting techniques is offered. We also propose a new classification of toll path problems. The tasks of cost minimization and time minimization for standard cutting technique (Continuous Cutting Problem, CCP) and for one of non-standard cutting techniques (Segment Continuous Cutting Problem, SCCP) are formalized. We show that the optimization tasks can be interpreted as discrete optimization problem (generalized travel salesman problem with additional constraints, GTSP). Formalization of some constraints for these tasks is described. For the solution GTSP we offer to use mathematical model of Prof. Chentsov based on concept of a megalopolis and dynamic programming. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},
