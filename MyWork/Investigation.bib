	abstract = {This paper deals with generating cutting paths for laser cutting machines by representing a tool path in a novel way. Using the new representation, the tool path problem can be viewed as finding a partitioning of contours which minimises the sum of the costs of a rooted directed minimum spanning tree to connect the partitions and the costs of a generalised travelling salesman problem (GTSP) solutions within each partition. Using Edmond-Lius algorithm to solve the arborescence problem, an improved Lin-Kernighan heuristic to solve the GTSP and a heuristic-repartitioning approach, tool paths can be generated that are 4.2\% faster than those generated by an existing tool path construction heuristic. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a new problem that arises when parts are cut from large plates of metal or glass. We call this problem the plate-cutting traveling salesman problem (P-TSP) because it requires the determination of a minimum-length tour such that exactly one point must be visited on each of a number of given polygons. We present a mathematical formulation of the problem and show that the problem is a variation of the well-known traveling salesman problem. We examine the problem when the order in which parts are to be cut is known. For this problem we present a Lagrangean decomposition of the problem and develop lower bounds and heuristics based on this decomposition. Computational testing on problems with 5-40 polygons reveals that the heuristics give fairly good solutions. When the order in which polygons are to be cut is known, the heuristic solutions are within 3-4\% of the optimal. The decomposition-based heuristics are embedded in a variable r-opt heuristic for the overall problem. © 1997 "IIE".},

	abstract = {In the paper the problem of tool path optimization for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) cutting machines is considered. The classification of the cutting techniques is offered. We also propose a new classification of toll path problems. The tasks of cost minimization and time minimization for standard cutting technique (Continuous Cutting Problem, CCP) and for one of non-standard cutting techniques (Segment Continuous Cutting Problem, SCCP) are formalized. We show that the optimization tasks can be interpreted as discrete optimization problem (generalized travel salesman problem with additional constraints, GTSP). Formalization of some constraints for these tasks is described. For the solution GTSP we offer to use mathematical model of Prof. Chentsov based on concept of a megalopolis and dynamic programming. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with generating paths for cutting irregular parts nested on a metal sheet. The objective is to minimize the total non-cutting time for the cutter head starting at a known location, cutting all the required elements and returning to the known location. In contrast to most literature on this topic, a part does not have to be cut at once. If this reduces the total non-cutting time, it is possible to cut a number of elements on a given part, then cut other parts and then return later to finish cutting the given part. The problem is modeled as a generalized traveling salesperson problem with special precedence constraints. An initial feasible solution is generated and improved by local moves embedded in a tabu search framework. The proposed algorithm shows promising results in comparison with a commercial software package on a limited set of test cases. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.},

The objective is to minimise the total time required to cut all parts from the metal sheet explicitly taking the cost of piercing and pre-cutting into account. The problem is modelled as a generalised travelling salesperson problem with special precedence constraints. A set of construction heuristics is presented that incorporates the constraints originating from inner-outer contours, common cuts, piercing points and pre-cuts. Computational tests on a set of real-life cutting problems show that our solution approach is able to generate tool paths that for thick plates spend on average 33.4\% less time than those generated by a commercial package for air movements, pre-cuts and sharp angle macros with cutting and piercing times being equal. © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

	doi = {10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.639.517},
	abstract = {This paper deals with non-trivial problem aspects of laser cutting tool path generation that, to the best of our knowledge, received relatively little attention in the scientific literature. It is shown that some aspects such as plate edge nesting, skeleton and remnant cutting, and clamp positioning can be modeled and solved with little additional effort using existing tool path algorithms. However, concepts such as collision avoidance, pre-cut optimization, and bridge utilization prove to be more challenging and will require more profound algorithmic adjustments if these have to be taken into account fully. An even harder problem aspect is generating tool paths that are thermally feasible. Since laser cutting introduces net heat into the metal sheet, the metal sheet tends to heat up as the cutting progresses. Quality deterioration can occur if the laser spends too much time cutting in the same region. It is shown how to model the easy problem extensions in order to handle them using existing problem approaches and solution approaches are suggested to tackle the harder concepts. In addition, a proof of concept is presented that shows that thermal feasible tool paths can be generated through a multi-start heuristic utilizing a thermal penalty function. A finite difference method iteratively (or concurrently dependent on the used heuristic) evaluates the thermal feasibility and updates the penalty function. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},
